	Korg Controller applescript for Wirecast and Black Magic ATEM

	Version: 1.0

	This script is a combination of multiple scripts that were found on the internet on how to control Wirecast using AppleScript.
	I am not sure who I need to credit all of the different code to.  I have restructured and added features to it and also tried
	to comment the code as well as write easy to follow instructions on how to use it.

	This code has added to it the use of a korg NanoPad for playing back up to 15 DDRs.  This separates the DDR from the
	nanoKontrol.  I left the original Intro, Outro and DDR on there but the problem is these buttons on the nanoKontrol
	are not designed to be a "toggle" but momentary.  Even though you can change the buttons to toggle and momentary,
	they do not seem to work reliably.

	The other addition you will see is that this script can also control an ATEM switcher at the same time it is using Wireast.
	You may ask why you would want to do this, I have a detiled explanation on my website at mikemyers.me under projects.
	I am using the ATEM as the switcher and Wirecast as teh graphics and DDR.

	This script also has an iPad interface using TouchOSC and OSCBridge.  All of the code can be retrieved by going to the 
	projects section on mikemyers.me or by viewing the github: https://github.com/netnutmike/Wirecast

	Note that there are different versions of this same script with just a few lines comment out to switch from an ATEM / Wirecast
	hybrid to a Wirecast Only as well as a different workflow setup for the NanoKontrol2.  The quickest way is to search for ATEM in the code
	to see where to make changes.

	FUNCTION: button

	DESCRIPTION:
		This function is called when a buton is pressed.  There is another function that determines which button is pressed.  This function is
		portable between different scripts and only the button detection routine needs to be swapped out.
